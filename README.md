# Cinnamon Notes Cruch Note Taker
Week #11 Project

## Description:
Pre-built frontend of a note taker app, and I added routes using express to the backend, and deployed it to heroku. It takes in input, displays it in the list on the left hand side without having to refresh the page, and you can also delete them. 

## Screenshots:
Coming Soon


## Usage:
Press the blue button to get started, then it takes you to a new page where you can insert the note title, and a description of the note. Press the save icon in the top right hand corner, and your note will be placed in the list on the left hand side of the screen. To delete a note press the trashcan on the right of the created note.

## Install:
Git clone, open vs code and the cloned project and run npm install in the terminal on your own computer. 

## What I Learned:
Deployment to Heroku.
Creating an express backend with the different routes. 
Reading and writing to files, a better understanding of that. 
How to use the util.promisify();
